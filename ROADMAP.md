# Decode the Word — Roadmap (Pragmatic + School-Ready)

This roadmap is ordered by: classroom impact, risk reduction, and “admin demo” value.

## Now (Stability + Cohesion)
- Make navigation consistent across all pages (labels, order, active states).
- Resolve all viewport edge cases (no overlap, no forced zoom, scroll works where needed).
- WCAG-ish contrast pass on headings, subtitles, tiles, keyboard, and HUD.
- Remove duplicate/legacy UI fragments that create “amateur” signals.

## Next (High-Impact Instructional Depth)
### Fluency (Speed Sprint)
- Expand passage bank by band and topic.
- Ensure passages don’t “run out” for 1–2 minute reads.
- Add optional prosody supports:
  - punctuation cues (pause at commas/periods)
  - intonation reminder prompts
  - “read it like a storyteller” variants
- Add simple teacher scoring helpers:
  - self-correction toggle
  - miscues categories (optional)

### Comprehension (Read & Think)
- Expand banks: more grade-banded sets, STEM/SEL themes.
- Add “discussion prompt” after check (teacher-led talk moves).
- Add readability indicators (lightweight estimates) as teacher-only metadata.

### Writing (Write & Build)
- Add sentence-combining mini-game (fix/run-ons, expand sentences, add transitions).
- Add “revise for clarity” prompts (strong verbs, precise nouns).

## Teacher Burden Lifters
- Teacher Resource Library (local-first):
  - save links (YouTube, PDFs, anchor charts) by skill/topic
  - export/import resources
- Quick “MTSS note” generator:
  - date, target skill, activity used, performance snapshot, next step
- Practice pack export v2:
  - consistent CSV schema
  - optional audio bundle hooks (if future MP3 library exists)

## Optional (Bigger Bets)
- Offline/PWA support:
  - cache app shell so it loads reliably in schools
- Accounts/sync (only if needed):
  - optional Google sign-in for syncing settings/resources across devices
  - keep “local-only” mode fully functional
- Native app wrappers (App Store/Play):
  - consider once the web version is stable + content-rich
