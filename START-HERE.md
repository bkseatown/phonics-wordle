   - index.html
   - script.js
   - style.css
   - words.js
3. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. Drag ALL files from this extracted folder
5. Commit changes
6. Wait 3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild

### Option 2: Replace Individual Files
1. For each file (index.html, script.js, style.css, words.js):
   - Click on the file in GitHub
   - Click pencil icon (edit)
   - Delete all content
   - Copy content from the file in this folder
   - Paste and commit
2. Repeat for all 4 core files

## ✅ After Upload - Verify It Works

1. **Wait 3 minutes** (GitHub Pages rebuild time)
2. **Open Incognito/Private window**
3. **Go to:** https://bkseatown.github.io/phonics-wordle/
4. **Press F12** to open console

### Success Looks Like:
```

✅ Enhanced Decode the Word loaded
✓ Keyboard initialized
```
**NO red error messages!**

### You Should See:
- ✅ Game board displays
- ✅ Word guessing works
- ✅ Voice dropdown has multiple options (not just "Auto-Select")
- ✅ Help, Teacher, Sounds buttons all work
- ✅ Modals open and close properly
- ✅ Audio playback works

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **words.js** - Added `const WORDS_DATA =` declaration (fixed syntax error)
2. **script.js** - Using your complete version with all functions (1886 lines)
3. **index.html** - Added cache-busting parameters to force reload
4. **Everything else** - Kept as-is (they were perfect!)

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Do NOT upload the incomplete 828-line script.js** - Use this complete 1886-line version
- **Cache-busting is built in** - Browsers will reload fresh files
- **All modal functions exist** - They were already in your older complete file
- **All game functions exist** - startNewGame, submitGuess, evaluate, etc.

## 🆘 If You Still See Errors

1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache:** Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
3. **Try Incognito mode:** Always works with fresh cache
4. **Wait longer:** Sometimes GitHub Pages takes 5-10 minutes

## 🎊 You're Done!

Just extract this ZIP, upload all files to GitHub, wait 3 minutes, and your phonics app will work perfectly!

**No more errors. No more confusion. Just upload and it works! 🚀**
